# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The game is controlled by key presses and allows you to play against the computer. The scoreboard updates after each round, tracking both your wins and the computer's wins.

## Features

- Computer randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors each round.
- Tracks wins for both the player and the computer.
- Displays a result for each round: win, lose, or draw.
- Option to reset the game by pressing `0`.

## How to Play
1. Open the webpage.
2. Use the following keys to make your choice:
    - `1` for Rock
    - `2` for Paper
    - `3` for Scissors
3. The computer will randomly select its choice, and the result (win/lose/draw) will be displayed.
4. Your score and the computer's score will be updated after each round.
5. Press `0` to reset the game.
